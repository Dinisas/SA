distortion in images introduced by uncalibrated cameras:

radial distortion -> causes straight lines to appear curved. Radial distortion becomes larger the farther points are from the center of the image.

tangential distortion -> occurs because the image-taking lense is not aligned perfectly parallel to the imaging plane. So, some areas in the image may look nearer than expected

camera calibration consists in determining the external parameters (rotation (R 3x3 matrix), translation (T, 3x1 matrix) -> position and orientation of the camera with respect to the real world) and the intrinsic parameters (focal length (f), distortion (parameters/coefficients k and p), principal point (cx,cy -> center of the image)). With this parameters we know the projection matrix in full, which is unique to a specific camera
