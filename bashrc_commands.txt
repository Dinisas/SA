On the Robot (Pioneer / RPi) terminal(s):

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.28.20:11311   # Robot's own IP here
export ROS_IP=192.168.28.20                        # Robot’s IP again here
# Do NOT set ROS_HOSTNAME here to avoid confusion

On your Laptop / Lab computer terminal(s):

this in bash.rc (nano ~/.bashrc)

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source ~/SA/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.28.20:11311  # Robot’s IP as ROS Master URI
export ROS_IP=192.168.28.50                        # Your Laptop’s own IP here
# Again, avoid setting ROS_HOSTNAME unless you have proper DNS

then just source ~/.bashrc

when running aruco_slam.launch offline:
use ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP as your own localhost
