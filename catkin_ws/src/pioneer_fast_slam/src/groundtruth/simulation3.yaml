# GROUND TRUTH ARUCO MARKER POSITIONS SIMULATION 3

# Ground truth ArUco marker positions (relative to robot's starting position)
# Coordinates are in meters, with robot start as origin (0,0)
# Measure these from your drawn map

markers:
  # Replace these example coordinates with your actual measured positions
  1: [5.08, 0]     # Marker ID 0 at 1.5m right, 2.0m forward from start
  0: [3.19, -1.12]     # Marker ID 0 at 1.5m right, 2.0m forward from start
  4: [0.34, -1.12]    # Marker ID 2 at 2.5m right, 1.0m behind start
  7: [2.01, 0.53]   # Marker ID 3 at 2.0m left, 1.5m behind start
  9: [0, -0.651]   # Marker ID 3 at 2.0m left, 1.5m behind start
  2: [0, 1.04]     # Add more markers as needed
  6: [0, 2.41]
  3: [1.62, 1.7]

  # Add all your markers here with their measured coordinates

# Robot starting position (this is your reference point - keep as 0,0)
robot_start: [0.0, 0.0]

# Optional: Add some metadata about your setup
measurement_info:
  map_scale: "1:100"  # If using a scaled drawing
  measurement_tool: "ruler"  # What you used to measure
  date_measured: "2024-12-XX"
  notes: "Measured from hand-drawn map of lab environment"
