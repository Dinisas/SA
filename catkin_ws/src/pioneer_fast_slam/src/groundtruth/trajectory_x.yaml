# GROUND TRUTH ARUCO MARKER POSITIONS AND TRAJECTORY - X PATTERN
# Enhanced ground truth data combining markers and X-shaped trajectory

# Ground truth ArUco marker positions (relative to robot's starting position)
# Coordinates are in meters, with robot start as origin (0,0)

# Ground truth robot trajectory positions (X-SHAPED PATH)
# List of [x, y] or [x, y, theta] positions representing the true robot path
# Theta will be calculated automatically from movement direction when not provided
positions:
  - [0.0, 0.0]        # Starting position
  - [2.47, 0.035]     # Moving east-northeast
  - [4.27, 0.07]      # Continuing east
  - [4.74, 0.18]      # Slight turn northeast
  - [4.83, 1.1]       # Sharp turn north (forming X)
  - [4.45, 1.58]      # Turn northwest
  - [4.61, 2.42]      # Final position northeast
