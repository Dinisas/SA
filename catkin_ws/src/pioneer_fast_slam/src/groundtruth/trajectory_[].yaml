# GROUND TRUTH ARUCO MARKER POSITIONS AND TRAJECTORY - SQUARE PATTERN
# Enhanced ground truth data combining markers and square/bracket-shaped trajectory

# Ground truth ArUco marker positions (relative to robot's starting position)
# Coordinates are in meters, with robot start as origin (0,0)

  2: [2.46, 0.89]    # Marker ID 2  
  5: [3.20, -0.71]   # Marker ID 5   
  6: [3.17, 0.89]    # Marker ID 6
  0: [4.82, -0.86]   # Marker ID 0
  1: [5.18, -0.25]   # Marker ID 1
  7: [5.18, 0.8]     # Marker ID 7
  8: [3.51, 2.52]    # Marker ID 8 (previously unknown)
  9: [5.02, 3.59]    # Marker ID 9 (previously unknown)
  3: [3.71, 3.59]    # Marker ID 3

# Ground truth robot trajectory positions (SQUARE/BRACKET-SHAPED PATH)
# List of [x, y] positions representing the true robot path
# Coordinates corrected to fix opposite direction issue (Y-axis flipped)
positions:
  - [0.0, 0.0]        # Starting position
  - [0.58, -0.27]     # Moving southeast (Y flipped)
  - [1.11, -0.46]     # Continuing southeast  
  - [2.01, -0.53]     # Moving more eastward
  - [3.47, -0.63]     # Continuing east
  - [3.92, -0.55]     # Slight adjustment
  - [4.01, -0.82]     # Turn south (was north)
  - [3.96, -1.65]     # Continuing south
  - [3.875, -2.605]   # Final position (Y flipped)
